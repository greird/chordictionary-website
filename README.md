Chordictionary - demo website
======

This is just the demo website for ChordictionaryJS, a web-based dynamic chord recognition and generation library for any fretted instrument.
It converts common chord tab notation, such as `x32010`, into its graphical representation, recognizes the chord and returns its real name and composition.

ChordictionaryJS is available here: https://github.com/greird/chordictionaryjs

**Please note this is work in progress and it is not 100% reliable yet.**
