Chordictionary - demo website
======

Web-based dynamic chord recognition and generation for any fretted instrument.
It converts common chord tab notation, such as `x32010`, into its graphical representation, recognizes the chord and returns its real name and composition.

**Please note this is work in progress and it is not 100% reliable yet.**
